/* - Show quests for a hero, but only highlight the next available.
   - Save progress when hero finishes an encounter, and when hero completes a quest
   - If a hero finished an encounter, they should not be able to do it again.
   - If a hero has already completed an encounter, instead of rendering the encounter, 
        you should render a text box saying the encounter has been completed.
   - The last page of a quest should render a [Complete Quest] button.
   - Completing a quest returns the hero back to the chapter list
